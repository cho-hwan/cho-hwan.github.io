Hi, I’m ChoHwan. I'm a student at INHA University.

This blog mostly captures my hobby projects and things I experiment with outside of work as and when I get time. My current focus is GPU programming, LLMs, and inference performance. 

This blog mostly captures my study notes and hobby projects as I dive deeper into engineering. Currently, I am exploring Linux kernel, Hardware design, and System optimization
